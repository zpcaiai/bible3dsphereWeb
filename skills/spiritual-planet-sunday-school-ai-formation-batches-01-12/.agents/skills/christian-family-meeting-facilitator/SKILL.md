# Goal

Family members can review rules without forced confession, retaliation or a meeting that becomes a trial.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 06 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Build agenda templates and timebox.
2. Show visibility and skip rules.
3. Capture decisions and unresolved items, not private narratives.
4. Schedule next review idempotently.
5. Route sensitive disclosures to authorized humans.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–05 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 孩子应知道家长控制能看到什么、谁能看、何时看和保存多久；不得强迫私密认罪。
- 勒索、成人与未成年人不当接触、自伤、跟踪或即时危险进入S2/S3，而非仅没收设备。

# Tests

- skip
- no private disclosure
- meeting visibility
- notification idempotency

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
