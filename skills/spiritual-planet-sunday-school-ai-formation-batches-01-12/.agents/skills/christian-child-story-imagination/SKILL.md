description: "Implement reviewed Bible stories, church history, literature and embodied retelling with source-type labels."

# Goal

Children’s imagination is formed by coherent stories without confusing fiction with Scripture or violating rights.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 07 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Require story type, reference and review status.
2. Check Scripture anchors and rights.
3. Generate questions and embodied response, not unreviewed full stories.
4. Block fictional details from Scripture claims.
5. Support parent/teacher facilitation.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–06 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 故事必须区分圣经、历史、见证与虚构，不得把AI添加细节说成经文或自动发布。

# Tests

- source labels
- copyright boundary
- review gate
- fiction/Scripture distinction

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
