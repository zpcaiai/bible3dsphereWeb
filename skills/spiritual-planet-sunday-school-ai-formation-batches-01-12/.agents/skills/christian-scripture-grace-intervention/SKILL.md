# Goal

Scenarios neither minimize harm nor trap learners in condemnation or AI-generated revelation.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 10 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Use approved Scripture anchors.
2. Separate authority levels.
3. Require truth, grace and action.
4. Add repair/help routes.
5. Block divine-message wording.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–09 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 经文/恩典介入必须同时保留真理、责任、修复和帮助；禁止廉价恩典、纯定罪或“神告诉你”式私人神谕。

# Tests

- anchor approval
- authority display
- no divine message
- truth/grace/action completeness

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
