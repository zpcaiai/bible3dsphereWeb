description: "Implement explainable rules, proportionate consequences, appeal, restoration and anti-humiliation gates."

# Goal

Family authority becomes transparent, bounded and restorative rather than arbitrary, shaming or spiritually coercive.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 05 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Inventory existing household rules.
2. Require purpose, age fit, consequence and restoration path.
3. Offer respectful appeal and review.
4. Hard-block humiliating, harmful or spiritual-threat templates.
5. Route coercive control and harm to safety.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–04 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 父母权柄不得被绝对化；禁止羞辱、身体伤害、属灵威胁、强迫披露和不相称惩罚。
- 保护儿童优先于家庭形象；伤害、虐待、强迫或即时危险进入S2/S3流程。

# Tests

- prohibited consequences
- appeal available
- age adaptation
- safety escalation

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
