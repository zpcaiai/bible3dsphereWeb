description: "Implement caregiver co-regulation, connection, transitions and repair for ages 0–6."
---

# Goal

Caregivers receive simple responsive practices without the product diagnosing attachment or using screens as the only soothing method.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 07 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Use caregiver self-guidance, not child surveillance.
2. Offer eye-level presence, emotion naming and co-regulation.
3. Build predictable transitions and repair.
4. Adapt for accessibility and caregiver capacity.
5. Route safety concerns to humans.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–06 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 0–6岁以依恋、回应、节律、故事、自由游戏和身体活动为主，不把AI或屏幕作为核心养育者。
- 不得对儿童生成依恋、发展、行为、救恩、信心或顺服诊断/评分。
- 屏幕转场不得羞辱孩子或突然以设备剥夺替代共同调节；同时保持清楚边界。

# Tests

- no diagnosis/capture
- accessible alternatives
- screen transition
- safety branch

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
