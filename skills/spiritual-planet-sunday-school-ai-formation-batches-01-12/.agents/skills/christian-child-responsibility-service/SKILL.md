# Goal

Children grow as contributors whose worth is not tied to task completion.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 07 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Set small actions and scaffold level.
2. Support visual cues and adult-with-child mode.
3. Avoid reward for every action and public leaderboard.
4. Review responsibility and repair.
5. Include service that respects recipients.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–06 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 不得对儿童生成依恋、发展、行为、救恩、信心或顺服诊断/评分。

# Tests

- support levels
- no leaderboard/worth link
- review date
- printable cues

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
