description: "Implement capability-level autonomy proposals, safety boundaries, review and recoverable rollback."

# Goal

Parents and youth can transfer governance progressively without secret monitoring or permanent one-failure punishment.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 08 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Model each capability separately.
2. Require youth proposal/voice and adult review.
3. Set responsibilities, safety and rollback.
4. Explain data visibility.
5. Record human decision, not maturity score.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–07 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 自治按能力逐步交还，必须有青少年声音、试行、复盘和恢复路径；一次失败不得永久全量回收。

# Tests

- capability states
- youth voice
- no secret monitoring
- temporary rollback

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
