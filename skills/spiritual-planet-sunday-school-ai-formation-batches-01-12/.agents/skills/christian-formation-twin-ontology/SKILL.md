description: "Implement profile, domain and consent boundaries that define what the twin is and is not."

# Goal

The product represents selected formation domains without collapsing the person into a score or model.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 11 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Resolve subject and authorized roles.
2. Select domains and sources explicitly.
3. Show prohibited inferences.
4. Support pause/revoke.
5. Version ontology and consent.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–10 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- Formation Twin只是经同意的有限领域镜像，不是灵魂、良心、属灵分身、临床模型或对一个人的终极解释。
- 不得生成总体属灵成熟分、救恩/呼召判断、未来属灵预测、隐藏特质、临床诊断或跨用户/家庭排名。

# Tests

- domain selection
- pause/revoke
- no prohibited inference
- version migration

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
