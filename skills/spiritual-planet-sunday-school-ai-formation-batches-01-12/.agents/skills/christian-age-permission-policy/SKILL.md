description: "Implement capability-specific, developmental permissions with trial periods, review and rollback."

# Goal

Children and teens receive increasing responsibility through transparent milestones rather than an all-or-nothing switch.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 06 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Model capabilities separately.
2. Set reason, state, review date and rollback condition.
3. Explain data visibility.
4. Prevent permanent ban after one failure.
5. Integrate Batch 07/08 age tracks.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–05 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 每条权限和区域规则必须保留紧急、照护、工作、学校和无障碍等真实例外。
- 违规处理必须相称、有修复和恢复路径；禁止公开羞辱、无限期惩罚和一次失败永久封禁。

# Tests

- capability matrix
- trial/review
- no permanent single-failure ban
- age transitions

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
