description: "Implement received identity, performed selves, pressure sources and truthful action without assigning labels."
---

# Goal

Youth can name pressures from school, appearance, relationships, family and church while remaining more than any label or performance.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 08 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Use optional categories and short summaries.
2. Show received identity anchors with review status.
3. Allow “still exploring” language.
4. Do not infer orientation or salvation.
5. Connect one truthful embodied action.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–07 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 青少年可以提问、怀疑、不同意或暂时不确定；禁止信仰答案评分、强迫归信和把疑问自动定性为悖逆。
- 不得给青少年分配身份标签、推断性取向、救恩、成熟度、隐藏罪或未来风险。

# Tests

- no label/inference
- reviewed anchors
- privacy
- age language

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
