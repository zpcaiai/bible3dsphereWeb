description: "Implement consent-based coarse observations from self, household, mentor or aggregate teacher roles."

# Goal

Relational fruit is observed humbly without scores, private-journal access or third-party narrative storage.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 11 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Resolve observer role and consent.
2. Use approved fruit categories.
3. Limit evidence length and visibility.
4. Add alternative explanations.
5. Block private journal access.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–10 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 关系观察必须有同意或合法角色，只能用粗粒度可观察果子，不能访问私人日记或生成关系质量分。

# Tests

- consent
- visibility
- no score/journal
- third-party redaction

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
