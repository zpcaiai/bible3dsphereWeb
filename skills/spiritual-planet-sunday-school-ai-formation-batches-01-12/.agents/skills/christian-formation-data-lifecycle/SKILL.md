description: "Implement purpose-bound retention, aggregation, deletion, export, pause, correction and revocable sharing."

# Goal

Formation data remains user-controlled and minimized, especially for children and youth.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 11 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Configure subject-type retention.
2. Run aggregation/deletion jobs idempotently.
3. Implement export excluding third-party data.
4. Implement transparent safety/audit exception.
5. Test revoked consent and purpose changes.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–10 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 数据必须目的限定、最短保留、儿童更少；导出/删除/暂停/纠正/撤销共享透明执行，审计例外不得静默。

# Tests

- retention jobs
- minor defaults
- export/delete
- exception transparency
- purpose consent

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
