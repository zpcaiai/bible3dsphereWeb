description: "Implement immutable evidence items and claim-to-evidence mapping for every readiness statement."

# Goal

No test, review or production-readiness claim can be issued without current, hash-bound evidence and explicit limitations.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 12 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Collect actual commands, human records and artifacts.
2. Hash evidence and bind environment/version.
3. Map each claim to evidence refs.
4. Reject not-run, expired or mismatched evidence.
5. Require human signatures and issue/expiry metadata.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–11 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 所有认证必须绑定artifact ID、版本、环境和不可变hash；过期、错配或缺失证据不得复用。
- 自动化可收集和验证证据，但神学、牧养、儿童保护、隐私安全和最终发布不得自动批准。
- 不得声称未实际运行的测试已通过；每条生产就绪声明必须引用真实命令/人工记录、时间、结果和限制。

# Tests

- command/result fidelity
- hash mismatch
- expiration
- claim mapping
- human signatures

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
