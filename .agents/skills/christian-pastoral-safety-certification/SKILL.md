# Goal

Ordinary formation never continues through an emergency path or disguises diagnosis, coercion or failed human handoff.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 12 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Inventory all safety entry points.
2. Run S0/S1/S2/S3 fixtures.
3. Verify interruption and local-resource configuration.
4. Review shame/coercion/diagnosis language.
5. Record human signoff and expiry.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–11 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 自动化可收集和验证证据，但神学、牧养、儿童保护、隐私安全和最终发布不得自动批准。
- 不得声称未实际运行的测试已通过；每条生产就绪声明必须引用真实命令/人工记录、时间、结果和限制。
- 任何儿童保护关键失败、S3中断失败、跨租户泄漏、敏感日志泄漏或未缓解关键安全缺陷都是发布阻断项。

# Tests

- S3 interruption
- failed handoff retry
- no diagnosis
- analytics exclusion
- human signoff

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
