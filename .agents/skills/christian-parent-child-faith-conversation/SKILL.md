description: "Implement open questions, “I do not know,” disagreement, simple prayer and adult follow-up."

# Goal

Children can be honest about faith without religious-answer scoring or coercive disclosure.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 07 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Use reviewed age-appropriate prompts.
2. Allow skip, uncertainty and disagreement.
3. Train adults to listen before correcting.
4. Do not infer belief or salvation.
5. Route safety disclosures separately.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–06 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 孩子可以提问、不同意或说不知道；不得把宗教答案当作内心信仰或价值评分。
- 涉及身体边界、虐待、不安全接触、自伤或即时危险时停止普通活动，禁止取证式追问并进入S2/S3。

# Tests

- no belief score
- skip/disagree
- adult follow-up
- safety separation

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
