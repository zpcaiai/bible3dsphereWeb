# Goal

Users see limited evidence states rather than overall maturity or future predictions.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 11 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Aggregate configured windows.
2. Require evidence IDs.
3. Return insufficient_data when appropriate.
4. Add confidence and explanation.
5. Prohibit overall state and hidden traits.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–10 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 不得生成总体属灵成熟分、救恩/呼召判断、未来属灵预测、隐藏特质、临床诊断或跨用户/家庭排名。
- 所有模式必须链接证据、标明不确定性和替代解释，并允许用户确认、修改或拒绝。

# Tests

- sparse data
- evidence links
- confidence
- no overall/prediction

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
