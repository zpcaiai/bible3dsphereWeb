description: "Implement fact separation, impact acknowledgment, proportional consequences, repair and rule adjustment."

# Goal

Digital conflicts become opportunities for truth and restored responsibility rather than shame or indefinite punishment.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 06 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Separate facts, interpretations and feelings.
2. Assign adult and child responsibility appropriately.
3. Offer repair actions and rule change.
4. Block forced confession and public shame.
5. Route protection concerns away from ordinary conflict.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–05 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 违规处理必须相称、有修复和恢复路径；禁止公开羞辱、无限期惩罚和一次失败永久封禁。
- 勒索、成人与未成年人不当接触、自伤、跟踪或即时危险进入S2/S3，而非仅没收设备。

# Tests

- prohibited punishment
- repair states
- adult inconsistency
- safety branch

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
