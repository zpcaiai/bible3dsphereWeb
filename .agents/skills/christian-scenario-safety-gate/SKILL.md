# Goal

Real danger exits simulation immediately and enters the existing protection system with minimal data.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 10 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Reuse Batch 01 safety and local contacts.
2. Map scenario signals to levels.
3. Interrupt S3 transactionally.
4. Exclude raw disclosure/evidence.
5. Audit notification and recovery.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–09 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 真实安全披露必须退出角色扮演；教师不得公开羞辱、承诺绝对保密或做取证式追问。

# Tests

- S3 transaction
- human owner
- no raw/evidence
- notification idempotency

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
