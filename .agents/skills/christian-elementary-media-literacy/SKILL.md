# Goal

Children learn to see persuasive design and values without storing media bodies or building susceptibility profiles.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 07 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Use adult-selected or locally viewed examples.
2. Ask observation before judgment.
3. Do not upload or persist content.
4. Create simple stop/reflect actions.
5. Support teacher group facilitation with aggregate privacy.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–06 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 不得采集儿童声音、照片、生物特征、精确位置、学校、第三方秘密或完整提示作为普通课程数据。
- 不得对儿童生成依恋、发展、行为、救恩、信心或顺服诊断/评分。

# Tests

- no content storage/profile
- age language
- group privacy
- teacher cards

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
