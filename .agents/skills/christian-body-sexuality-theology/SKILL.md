name: christian-body-sexuality-theology
description: "Implement reviewed, age-aware Christian body, sexuality, consent, non-coercion, marriage and singleness content."
---

# Goal

The module teaches bodily dignity, covenant responsibility and safe boundaries without shame, graphic content or universalizing product defaults as Scripture.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 04 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Map denominationally sensitive claims to authority/review levels.
2. Create adult, marriage, singleness, parent and supervised older-teen variants.
3. Require consent/non-coercion and help-seeking content.
4. Block graphic or individualized sexual-history prompts.
5. Add reviewer workflows and rights checks.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–03 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 不得采集、上传、保存、回放、生成或转发色情/露骨材料；只保存最小类别和安全决策。
- 未成年人不得进入私密AI亲密聊天，不得被要求披露个人性史或接受露骨示范。
- 所有敏感神学、性教育、未成年人和牧养内容必须经过对应人工审核才能发布。
- Marriage and singleness must not become worth rankings.

# Tests

- age-content matrix
- review workflow
- blocked content tags
- screen-reader-safe language

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
