# Goal

Authors can create realistic formation exercises without explicit content or autobiographical pressure.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 10 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Require learning goal and audience.
2. Build typed node graph with no dead ends.
3. Apply sensitivity/review matrix.
4. Use fictional distance and safe language.
5. Version and preview as draft.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–09 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 所有情境必须虚构、非露骨、可跳过且经过相应神学/牧养/儿童安全审核；不得要求学习者重演真实创伤。
- 合成基准只证明工程行为，不得宣称真实属灵成长、临床效果或生产安全已获证明。

# Tests

- graph/no dead end
- review tags
- no explicit/real history
- draft preview

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
