description: "Implement evidence-category review for advancing, holding, trialing or temporarily rolling back autonomy."
---

# Goal

Governance changes remain human-reviewed and explainable rather than automatic maturity certification.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 08 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Gather youth and adult reflections separately.
2. Use evidence categories, not scores.
3. Require human decision and review date.
4. Document recovery after rollback.
5. Preserve appeal and audit.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–07 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- 自治按能力逐步交还，必须有青少年声音、试行、复盘和恢复路径；一次失败不得永久全量回收。

# Tests

- no automatic advance/score
- separate reflections
- decision audit
- appeal/review

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
