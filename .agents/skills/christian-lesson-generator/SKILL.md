# Goal

Teachers receive editable lesson variants that retain the central outcome and never auto-publish.

# Activation boundary

Use this skill for repository implementation, refactoring, review or testing of the named Batch 09 capability. Do not trigger it for a generic devotional answer, abstract theology discussion or a request that does not change or inspect the Spiritual Planet product.

# Implementation workflow

1. Require approved source course/unit.
2. Choose core versus optional activities.
3. Validate duration including transitions.
4. Generate teacher draft with provenance.
5. Keep state draft/review until approval.

# Data, privacy and integration rules

- Reuse Batch 01–08 identifiers, authority labels, S0–S3 safety routing, content review, RBAC, tenant scoping, deletion/export and analytics allowlists.
- Validate at every trust boundary and reject unknown fields. Persist only the minimum structured data necessary for the user-visible function.
- Do not persist raw sensitive narratives, private messages, hidden browsing history, explicit content or third-party identities merely because the model can process them.
- Keep policy decisions explainable and versioned. Human review requirements cannot be bypassed by model confidence.
- Build mobile, keyboard, screen-reader and reduced-motion behavior using the existing design system.

# Invariants

- AI可以起草和建议，但不得批准、自动发布、静默重排正式课程或把未审核内容展示给学习者。

# Tests

- duration math
- core objective preserved
- draft status
- provenance

# Definition of done

The capability is integrated into the existing module, has versioned contracts and migrations where needed, passes repository-native tests, preserves user agency, and cannot silently violate the listed safety, privacy, age, theological or publication boundaries.
